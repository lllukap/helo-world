                    <h3> Behind The Scenes</h3>
                    <p class="content-container-text"> The movie was originally created for the NYUAD IM 30 minute Film Festival. The purpose of the festival was to encourage young creators to come up with ideas and display them using video format. The main requirement was that the whole production of the movie had to take no longer than 30 minutes. Our movie "Chocolate Wanted: getting what you want at NYUAD" was based on a true story of an NYUAD student and explores the challenges one has to overcome in this university, which often range from struggles in getting into a favourable course to overstepping one's fear of asking a classmate for help (or - for chocolate!).</p>

                  <h3> About The Director</h3>
                  <p class="content-container-text"> The movie was directed by Lukrecija Paulikaite, a Lithuanian filmmaker and photographer. Lukrecija is currently a first-year student at NYUAD, which allowed her to showcase the conventional and long-existing challenges from a fresh perspective. Being familiar with the issues displayed in the movie in her personal life, she relates deeply to the main message of her creation and hopes that the audience will be able to connect just as deeply. </p>

                 <div class="content-item">
                     <h3> About The Cast</h3>
                     <p class="content-container-text"> The selection of actors was not accidental. The director casted students with no prior experience in acting on purpose, in order to reflect the raw reality of what is it like being a student at NYUAD. No one would be better equipped to reveal the intricacies of student life as the students themselves, the true actors in their real lives. Special attention should be given to the main actress Mariyam, whose exceptional talent and performance have contributed greatly to the director's vision. Her dedication is deeply appreciated. </p>
