Project name:
Chocolate Wanted: getting what at NYUAD

Project Description:
The aim of the project was to build a website that would host the 30FF video and enhance the experience of watching the video. It was intended that the website would contain additional information about the video, such as details about the actors, director and main message, so that the viewer could engage deeper with the main element – the video.

The idea behind the layout and arrangement of the different pieces of information was to first spark the viewer’s interest to watch the video. By putting the project description, reviews and behind the scenes pictures first, I attempted to make the first page of the website to function as a commercial for the video. Getting the viewer to watch the video requires some persuasion: I wanted the viewer to build-up suspense and interest as he/she scrolls through the page. Firstly, the viewer would form his own impression by reading the main details. Secondly, the review section and the positive opinions of others would hopefully motivate further to click on the video. Third, the formed impression would additionally be complemented by some visual information about the main element. Lastly, the ticket button would take the viewer to another page, where he/she was able to see the video without distractions.

The design of the website was chosen to compliment the idea of arousing curiosity and sparking viewer’s interest. The dark theme was chosen to aid in building up suspense. Shades of dark blue were chosen to aid in creating the darker theme, but at the same time to make the viewer feel calm and serene, since blue is often associated with feelings of peacefulness, security and calmness. 


Evaluation:
Overall, I consider my project to be successful. As someone who has not coded previously at all, I was pleasantly surprised how the website turned out. 

I believe I was able to design the website according to my goal of sparking viewer’s interest first and stay consistent. Personally, I really liked the “Claim your Movie Ticket” section and the button; I feel like it reflects my primary aim and is a nice conclusion of the main page. Additionally, I enjoyed the animated part of the website, such as the lighting-up of the boxes, buttons, and the “lights-off” function surrounding the video.

Nevertheless, I think that the coding part could have been a little cleaner and clearer. It is especially vivid in the positioning of different elements, as I often ended up using measuring in pixels rather than choosing alternative methods that would allow me to better center the different boxes and make them stay relatively the same on other types of screens. Also, the slideshow element does not fully function as I intended it too, the viewer must press on the dots for the slides to appear. If I was to develop this website further, I would invest more time into correct positioning of the elements, solve the slideshow issue and add a footer with contact information, since, looking back, I feel like it is one of the main features that is missing.
